## Description

This documentation outlines steps regarding installation, customization, and usage of [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) as a primary penetration testing system on various platforms.

## Installation (amd64 x86_64)

### Requirements

### Customizing the installation

*Note: for a standard installation, see [Preparing the installation media](#preparing-the-installation-media).*

#### Requirements

- Reliable internet connection
- Windows 10
- Hypervisor (preferrably [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/))

#### Setting up the live-build system

Download the latest Kali Linux build from [here](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) and install it in a virtual machine. Use default Kali installation setting (ie. no encryption or fancy partitioning), and set up bridged networking in your virtual machine's settings in order to transfer the compiled image to your host.

Make sure the system is up to date.

`apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`

Set up the live build environment.

`apt-get install git live-build cdebootstrap`

`git clone git://git.kali.org/live-build-config.git && cd live-build-config`

#### Configuring the package list

Other variants can be used, but the Gnome one should work fine for most situations. Edit live-build-config/kali-config/variant-gnome/package-lists/kali.list.chroot to your liking.

*Note: Lines that start with a "#" are treated as comments and are ignored by the compiler.*

For more information, see [Kali Metapackages](https://tools.kali.org/kali-metapackages).

#### Building the image

`./build.sh --verbose --distribution kali-rolling --variant gnome`

*Note: If you have selected another variant, be sure to change that here.*

#### Configuring SSH for host-guest communication

Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to replace `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password` with `PermitRootLogin yes.`.

Normally this would be a security risk, however since this is in a virtual machine on a presumably private network, it should be fine.

Enable the SSH server to automatically launch on startup.

`systemctl enable ssh`

Restart the SSH server.

`service ssh restart`

#### Transferring the image to the host machine via scp

From the host machine, run the following.

`scp root@GUEST_IP:~/live-build-config/images/kali-linux-gnome-rolling-amd64.iso C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\kali-linux-gnome-rolling-amd64.iso`

The ISO image should now be on your desktop. If an error appears stating that remote host identification has failed, run `ssh-keygen -R X.X.X.X` to fix it.

### Preparing the installation media

Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) and run it with administrator privileges. Be sure to select DD write mode, otherwise the Kali installation process may fail. Optionally, on linux machines, you can use dd `dd if=/PATH/TO/KALI/ISO of=/dev/sdX bs=512k`. Be careful with this method though, as any syntax errors can be catastrophic!

### Installing the system

#### Requirements

- Reliable internet connection
- Any Linux-compatible x64-based system with at least a 32 GB storage capacity

#### Installation

**WARNING: The following process will erase any data on the disk. Back up any important data before proceeding.**

In order to ensure speed and reliability during installation, a wired internet connection to the target system is recommended. Additionally, for extra security, select "Separate /home, /usr, /var, and /tmp partitions" and "Guided- use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM" when prompted. Note that this will encrypt your system, potentially reducing performance and requiring you to enter a passphrase during each boot.

## Installation (Raspberry Pi)

### Requirements

- Computer with internet access
- Raspberry Pi
- 16 GB or larger SD card (prefferably class 10)
- USB SD card reader (unless your PC has an SD card slot)
- Ethernet cable/adapter (optional)

*Note: Other platforms may work, however these instructions have only been tested on the [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) and [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) models.*

### Installation

Since the Raspberry Pi uses an SD card for storage, the installation process is much different and arguably simpler than on other platforms. To get started, download [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and the appropriate image for your platform from [here](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/).

| Model | Image | Download | Download (torrent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ | Kali Linux RaspberryPi 2 and 3 64 bit | [https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2019.2a-rpi3-nexmon-64.img.xz](https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2019.2a-rpi3-nexmon-64.img.xz) | [https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2019.2a-rpi3-nexmon-64.img.xz.torrent](https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2019.2a-rpi3-nexmon-64.img.xz.torrent) |
| Raspberry Pi Zero W | Kali Linux RPi0w Nexmon | [https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2019.2-rpi0w-nexmon.img.xz](https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2019.2-rpi0w-nexmon.img.xz) | [https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2019.2-rpi0w-nexmon.img.xz.torrent](https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2019.2-rpi0w-nexmon.img.xz.torrent) |

Plug the SD card into your PC and start Etcher. After selecting the image you downloaded and the target as the SD card, press "Flash!" and wait a few minutes. Be patient, as this may take some time depending on your hardware.

**WARNING: Take care to select the correct target, as this process will overwrite any existing data.**

After Etcher finishes, eject the SD card and plug it into the Pi. Connect an ethernet cable to the Pi and boot (for the models that do not have an ethernet port, something like [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2992?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4uf__Z3R4wIVhtlkCh13Dw9XEAQYCCABEgL1DPD_BwE) can be used). If a wired connection is not available, add the your network to wpa_supplicant.conf in the root of the SD card the using the following syntax.

```
network={
  ssid="SSID"
  psk="PASSWORD"
}
```

SSH should be enabled by default, so find whatever IP address the Pi was assigned and connect to it using `ssh root@X.X.X.X`. The default password should be "toor" as usual with Kali systems. If an error appears stating that remote host identification has failed, run `ssh-keygen -R X.X.X.X` to fix it.

After installation, sometimes the full space of the SD card is not utilized. Run the following to expand the partitions to fit the SD card.

`chmod ~/scripts/rpi-wiggle.sh`

`sh ~/scripts/rpi-wiggle.sh`

*Note: It is perfectly normal to have around 800 MB of unallocated space at the end of the card. Don't worry about this.*

## Additional setup

### Updating

It is always a good idea to update your system before doing anything else, as errors can arise later on if you don't. This process will take a while depending on how long ago the installation image was built.

`sudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade`

### Setting up user accounts

#### Changing the root password

The default root password in Kali is "toor." To change this, log into the root account and type `passwd`.

#### Adding a new non-root user

By default, Kali Linux only has a root user. This is because Kali is meant to run most of its software under sudo privileges. If you are considering using Kali as a daily-use system (not recommended) or you want to log into Kali remotely over SSH, it is advisable to create a non-root user.

Create the new user (the -m flag creates a new home directory for the user).

`useradd -m username`

Set a password for the new user.

`passwd username`

*Note: It is best practice to set the user's password to something other than the root or disk encryption passwords.*

Give the new user sudo privileges.

`usermod -a -G sudo username`

Set the shell for the new user.

`chsh -s /bin/bash username`

#### Deleting a non-root user

To delete and remove all traces of a non-root user, run

`userdel â€“r user1`

**WARNING: This will remove the user's home directory as well so back up any necessary data/settings.**

### Setting the hostname

`hostnamectl set-hostname HOSTNAME`

### Configuring SSH

SSH is usually disabled by default on amd64 x86_64 systems, however can easily be enabled.

`apt install openssh-server`

Enable the SSH server to start on boot.

`systemctl enable ssh`

#### Generating new SSH keys

Generating new SSH keys should be done to ensure a secure connection, as the ones that came with the system are the same on every fresh installation, allowing attackers to conduct easy MITM attacks.

Back up the existing keys.

`mkdir /etc/ssh/backup-keys`

`mv /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* /etc/ssh/backup-keys`

Generate new keys

`cd /etc/ssh/`

`dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server`

Confirm the change by running `md5sum` on both sets of keys and comparing the outputs. The hash values should be different.

`md5sum /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*`

`md5sum /etc/ssh/default_kali_keys/ssh_host_*`

### Disabling the GUI

Sometimes, especially on lower-end hardware such as a Raspberry Pi, it is desirable to save system resources by disabling the desktop environment. This will allow you to boot into a the Linux TTY. You should still be able to start a graphical interface at any time by typing `startx`.

Disable the GUI.

`systemctl set-default multi-user.target`

Changes will take effect after a reboot. To revert to default, use `graphical.target` instead.

### Installing Tor

Tor is included in some distributions' repositories, however it is not regularily updated. Tor should be downloaded from the [source](https://www.torproject.org/) to ensure it is fully up to date.

Add the source repository to /etc/apt/sources.list.

`echo 'deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org stretch main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list`

`echo 'deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org stretch main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list`

Import the Tor project signing key to the apt keyring.

`wget -O- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | sudo apt-key add -`

Update and install Tor.

`apt-get update`

`apt-get install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring`

## Troubleshooting

### Known issues

- After a fresh installation, /etc/apt/sources.list may be empty, causing apt operations to fail.
  - **Fix:** Replace the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list with the latest [repositories](https://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories).
